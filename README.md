# 1. Kickstarter Analysis
##   1.1 Overview and purpose of the project
       Analysis were made to the kickstarter data to recognise and visualize any trends between the successrate 
       and that of funding goals and launch date.
       The outcome of the analysis is shown in graphs.
##   1.2 Analysis and Challenges
       The analysis is performed in 2 parts.
       Part 1 is to visualize any link between launch date and a successful outcome for the theater category.
       Part 2 is to see if there are any links between funding goals and success rate for a specific subcategory plays.
###  1.2.1 Analysis of outcome based on Launch date
       The analysis carried out consists of looking to see if there is a link between successful funding goals and launch date.
       For this task, a table is created counting the successful outcomes, failed outcomse and canceled outcomes for each month,
       and for all the years.
       
 #### Graph1: Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date

       As shown in Graph1, the most successful month range to launch theater is between April and August, with May having the top 
       peek for successful theater launches.
       The data also show the launch successrate decrease towards the end of the year
       We can also see that the successful and fail outcomes follow the same trend. 

###  1.2.2 Analysis of outcome based on funding goals
       The analysis carried out consists of looking at specific funding goal ranges, and decide if one funding goal range performs better
       than any other one, or if there is a trend between the funding goals and success rate. For this task, Graph2 is created to plot the outcome based
       on funding goals against some predefined funding goal ranges.
       
#### Graph2: Outcome based on funding goals for subcategory Plays

       As shown in Graph2, the highest successrate is in the region of $0-$4999 and starts have a steady decrease 
       in successrate until the graph reaches the higher end of the funding goals, in the range of $25000-$29999. After this region, 
       thesuccess rate is increasing again to have a sudden drop towards the higher funding goal range.
       There are also no cancelation in the play category, as seen in Graph2.
