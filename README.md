# 1. Kickstarter Analysis
##   1.1 Overview and purpose of the project
       Analysis are made to the kickstarter data to recognize and visualize any trends between the success rate 
       and that of funding goals and launch date specificaly for the theater category and plays. 
       The outcome of the analysis is shown in graphs.
# 2. Analysis and Challenges
       The analysis is performed in 2 parts.
       Part 1 is to visualize any link between launch date and outcome for the theater category.
       Part 2 is to  visualize any link between funding goals and outcome for theater and subcategory plays.
       The main challenge with this project is to sort and plot the relevant data to visualize a com 
       
       
##   2.1 Analysis of outcome based on Launch date
       The analysis carried out consists of looking to see if there is a link between successful funding goals and launch date.
       For this task, a table is created counting the successful outcomes, failed outcomse and canceled outcomes for each month,
       and for all the years. The results are ploted in Graph1.
       
 #### Graph1: Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date

       As shown in Graph1, the most successful month range to launch theater is between April and August, with May having the most 
       successful theater launches.
       The data also show the launch success rate decrease towards the end of the year, with December having the least 
       successful outcome.

##     2.2 Analysis of outcome based on funding goals
       For this analysis, some predefined funding goal ranges are used to decide if one funding goal range performs better
       than any other one, or if there is a trend between the funding goals and success rate. 
       The results are shown in Graph2
       
#### Graph2: Outcome based on funding goals for subcategory Plays

       As shown in Graph2, the highest successrate is in the region of $0-$4999. After this region the successrate starts to 
       decrease and than picks up again between the regions of $25000 -$44999, and drops to 0 and increase again slightly.
       There are also no cancelation in the play category, as seen in Graph2.
       
# 3.Results       
##  3.1 Outcome based on launch date-results
        From the Graph1, three conclusions can be made:
        * Highest success rate for theater is in May.
        * Lowest success rate for theater is in December.
        
        
##  3.2 Outcome based on funding goal-results
        From Graph2, the following  two conclusion can be made:
        * Highest successrate for funding goals are in the region of 0-$4999
        * There are no cancellations 
      
 # 4. Limitations of Datasets
##   4.1 Outcome based on launchdate-limitations
        As shown in Graph1, the highest theater lanches are most successful during may month, however during the same month, we can
        see an increase in failed launches. We can look into the outcome proportions. We can see if this trend is the same if we isolate
        a country we are interested in launching our theatre in. We can also see if there is a genre that is more popular in the theater category       

 ##   4.2 Outcome based on goals-limitations
       
        Limitations:
        * The graph does not show proportion of outcome vs total project for each goal range. It can be useful to see the total project
          for each defined goal range.
        * It can be useful to look closer to the goal ranges wehre success rate is higher and find out if there is any links to other
          parameters.
        * The graph does not limit our findings to any specific country. Different countries might have different trends.
