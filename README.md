# 1. Kickstarter Analysis
##   1.1 Overview and purpose of the project
       Analysis were made to the kickstarter data to recognise and visualize any trends between the successrate and that of funding goals and launch date.
       The outcome of the analysis is shown in graphs.
##   1.2 Analysis and Challenges
       The analysis was performed in 2 parts.
       Part 1 was to visualize any link between launch date and a successful outcome for the relevant entertainment categories.
       Part 2 was to see if there are any links between funding goals and success rate for the same entertainment categories.
###  1.2.1 Analysis of outcome based on Launch date
       The analysis carried out consists of looking to see if there is a link between successful funding goals and launch date.
       For this task, a table is created counting the successful outcomes, failed outcomse and canceled outcomes for each year.

#### Graph1: Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date
       
       As shown in Graph1, the most successful months to launch theater is between April and August, with May having the top peek for successful theater launches.
       We can also see that the successful and fail outcomes follow the same trend. 

###  1.2.2 Analysis of outcome based on funding goals
       The analysis carried out consists of looking at the various funding goal ranges, and decide if one funding goal range performs better
       than any other one, or if there is a trend between the funding goals and success rate.
